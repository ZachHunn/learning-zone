Certainly! Here's an updated version of the exercise without the hover effect and with additional instructions related to list decoration:

# Exercise 06: Formatting a List

Create a folder within the "css_exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g., "John-Exercise-5"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html" and a CSS file named "style.css". Then complete the exercise.

## Instructions

1. Inside the HTML file, create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with at least five list items (`<li>`).
2. Apply the following styles using CSS:
   - Set the background color of the list.
   - Add padding to the list items.
   - Remove the default bullet points for the list items.
   - Style the list items with a different list marker.
   - Apply alternating background colors to improve readability.
   - Set a specific width for the list.
   - Add a border to the list and adjust its color, thickness, and style.
   - Apply text alignment to the list items.
   - Add additional list decoration (e.g., underline, overline, strike-through) to the list items.

Example Structure

index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 5</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

style.css:
```css
/* Add your CSS styles here */
```

Finalize Your Exercise

1. Save your HTML and CSS files.
2. Open your HTML file in a web browser to view the list and check if the CSS styles are applied correctly.
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the CSS rules to achieve the desired visual presentation.
4. Validate your HTML and CSS code using online validators to ensure they follow proper syntax and structure.

When you are ready to submit your exercise, commit and push the HTML and CSS files to the Git repository.
