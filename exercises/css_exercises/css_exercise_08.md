# Exercise 08: Responsive Design

Create a folder within the "css_exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g., "John-Exercise-8"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html" and a CSS file named "style.css". Then complete the exercise.

## Instructions

1. Inside the HTML file, create a simple web page structure with a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer.
2. Apply the following styles using either Flexbox or CSS Grid:
   - Create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
   - Make the header and footer span the full width of the screen.
   - Arrange the navigation menu and main content area in a column or row layout, depending on the screen size.
   - Implement a responsive design pattern, such as a collapsible navigation menu for small screens.
   - Use appropriate spacing, padding, and margins to create a visually appealing layout.
   - Apply a responsive font size or line height to ensure readability on different devices.
   - Add a media query to adjust the layout or styling for specific screen sizes.

index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>

    </ul>
  </nav>
